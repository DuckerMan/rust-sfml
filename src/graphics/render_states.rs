/// Define the states used for drawing to a `RenderTarget`.
///
/// There are four global states that can be applied to the drawn objects:
///
/// - the blend mode: how pixels of the object are blended with the background
/// - the transform: how the object is positioned/rotated/scaled
/// - the texture: what image is mapped to the object
/// - the shader: what custom effect is applied to the object
///
/// High-level objects such as sprites or text force some of these states when they are drawn.
/// For example, a sprite will set its own texture, so that you don't have to care about it
/// when drawing the sprite.
///
/// The transform is a special case: sprites, texts and shapes
/// (and it's a good idea to do it with your own drawable classes too) combine their transform
/// with the one that is passed in the RenderStates structure.
/// So that you can use a "global" transform on top of each object's transform.
///
/// Most objects, especially high-level drawables, can be drawn directly without defining
/// render states explicitly â€“ the default set of states is ok in most cases.
///
/// ```ignore
/// window.draw(sprite);
/// ```
///
/// To draw with a specific render state, use `RenderTarget::draw_with_renderstates`.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use sfml::graphics::*;
/// # let mut window: RenderWindow = unimplemented!();
/// # let shader: Shader = unimplemented!();
/// # let sprite: Sprite = unimplemented!();
/// let mut states = RenderStates::default();
/// states.shader = Some(&shader);
/// window.draw_with_renderstates(&sprite, states);
/// ```
///
/// When you're inside the `draw` function of a drawable object (implementing `Drawable`),
/// you can either pass the render states unmodified, or change some of them.
/// For example, a transformable object will combine the current transform with its own transform.
/// A sprite will set its texture. Etc.
